# 🧑‍💻 Developers

📕 I started writing some docs [here](https://github.com/mxrch/GHunt/wiki) and examples [here](https://github.com/mxrch/GHunt/tree/master/examples), feel free to contribute !

To use GHunt as a lib, you can't use pipx because it uses a venv.\
So you should install GHunt with pip :
```bash
$ pip3 install ghunt
```

And now, you should be able to `import ghunt` in your projects !\
You can right now play with the [examples](https://github.com/mxrch/GHunt/tree/master/examples).
